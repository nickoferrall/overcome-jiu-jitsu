# Overcome Jiu Jitsu Website

This is a gym website built with Next.js. You are updating it for Overcome Jiu Jitsu.

## Project Structure
- `pages/` or `app/` - Main page components
- `components/` - Reusable UI components
- `public/` - Static assets (images, etc.)
- `styles/` - CSS and theme configuration

## When Updating Content
- Keep the existing component structure intact
- Update text content to match the target gym
- Replace placeholder images with real ones from the gym's website
- Keep the template's existing fonts and color scheme (don't copy their old site's styling)
- Update favicon (/app/favicon.ico) with the gym's logo
- IMPORTANT: Find and verify their actual social media links from their website footer/header
  - Don't leave placeholder social links - use their real profiles or remove if they don't have them

## SEO Requirements
- Every page needs a unique, descriptive title tag with gym name and location
- Add meta descriptions (150-160 chars) with relevant keywords
- Use proper heading hierarchy (one H1 per page, followed by H2s, H3s)
- Add alt text to all images
- Include structured data for local business schema
- Add OpenGraph meta tags for social sharing

## AI Integration
- The org ID and phone number are already configured in `.env.local`
- Contact forms and AI features will work automatically
- Don't modify the API routes or AI integration code

## Guidelines
- Use semantic HTML for SEO and accessibility
- Maintain accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Keep the responsive design working
- Test on mobile and desktop views

## After Completing Updates
